# Committee Status
Committee status viewing displays real time updates for what is going on in a committee. This page can be viewed by clicking the magnifying glass icon on a committee

## Value syncing
As information changes in a committee, it updates to reflect those changes. If the name, moderator, agenda, attendance, etc. change about a committee, it updates on the status page

## Current Action
The status page also reflects the current action taken by the committee. Actions include:
* Out of Session
* Setup
* GSL
* Motions
* Mod
* Unmod
* Voting

These actions also update in real time. The actions GSL, mod, and unmod also all have a timer that is synced between the session and the status viewing. Whenever a timer is started or stopped in a session, the proper time value is reflected on the status page
